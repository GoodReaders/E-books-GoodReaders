With a plot that delivers stolen diamonds, masked balls, purloined letters, and, of course, great bouts of swordplay, The Three Musketeers is eternally entertaining."

The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde dramatically brings to life a case study of the nature of good and evil and the duality that can exist within one person. Today Stevenson's novella is recognized as an incisive study of Victorian morality and sexual repression, as well as a great thriller."

These points of view intermingle to intriguing effect in his short story, “What Christmas Is As We Grow Older,” when the old optimism rears its head again and reaffirms his belief in goodness and the memory of better days and the love between family and dear friends."
